## ❓ Quiz Time

1. **"Can Neural Networks exist without Machine Learning?"**  
   - **Answer:** No! Neural Networks are a **subset of Machine Learning**.  
   - **Explanation:**  
     - ML is the broader field where algorithms learn from data.  
     - Neural Networks (and Deep Learning) are advanced ML techniques inspired by the human brain.  
     - **Example:** You can't have a "branch" (Neural Networks) without the "tree" (ML).  

2. **"What comes under Data Science?"**  
   - **Answer:** Machine Learning (ML) + Data Analytics + Data Engineering.  
   - **Breakdown:**  
     - **Machine Learning:** Building predictive models (e.g., recommendation systems).  
     - **Data Analytics:** Extracting insights (e.g., sales trends, dashboards).  
     - **Data Engineering:** Managing data pipelines (e.g., ETL, databases).
